# Logitech MX Master 4S Action Ring Macros for AutoCAD Electrical

### Requirements

- Logitech MX Master 4 (I have not tested on other devices that support "Action Ring"
- Logi Options+
- AutoCAD Electrical (Tested on 2024)

This repository provides a ready-to-use **Logi Options+** profile that turns the **Action Ring** (gesture button + directions) on the Logitech MX Master 4S (and 3S) into an ultra-fast command launcher specifically optimized for **AutoCAD Electrical**.

This is still a work in progress as I just replaced my G604 which I mapped for AutoCAD Electrical years ago.  Without finding any profile online this is my attempt to make one for others.
- The .bmp and .png files currently used are included.

# Exporting AutoCAD Electrical Icons

You can add further macros to fit your needs as well as Icons.  To find the Icons, enter "CUI" in the Command Line. 
<br />

<img width="1048" height="733" alt="CUI" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d27190f-c25d-4be1-ba65-d0c53a91f4fb" />

<br />
<br />

These Icons then need to be converted from .bmp to .png or other supported Logitech Icon Format.
In my case I used Inkscape.  With the Supplied "TEMPLATE.svg", import the new Icon into the project and replace the existing.
